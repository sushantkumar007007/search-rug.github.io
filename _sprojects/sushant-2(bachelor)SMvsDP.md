description: Investigate how the application of different design patterns (e.g., Singleton, Factory Method) impacts software maintainability in real-world projects. The study will involve analyzing open-source repositories to measure metrics such as cyclomatic complexity, code readability, and bug frequency.

title: Impact of Design Patterns on Software Maintainability using LLM
types:
- BSc thesis
---

Design patterns are widely considered as best practices in software engineering. However, their impact on long-term software maintainability remains an open question. This thesis will explore metrics such as cyclomatic complexity, code readability, and bug frequency in projects employing various design patterns.

The contributions of this thesis will include:
1. Investigating the relationship between design patterns and maintainability.
2. Performing an empirical analysis of open-source repositories.

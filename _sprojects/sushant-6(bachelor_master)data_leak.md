The increasing integration of connected systems in modern vehicles has enhanced functionality but also introduced significant risks related to data leakage. Data leakage in automotive software can expose sensitive user information, compromise vehicle safety, or lead to intellectual property theft. This project will explore the following:

1. **Identification**: Analyze how data leakage occurs in automotive systems, including connected infotainment systems, communication protocols, and IoT integrations.
2. **Implications**: Investigate the impact of such leaks on end-users and manufacturers, considering privacy, safety, and regulatory compliance.
3. **Mitigation**: Propose solutions to detect and prevent data leakage in real-time, using techniques like encryption, secure communication protocols, and runtime monitoring.
